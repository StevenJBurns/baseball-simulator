Baseball simulator javascript program

On each run, simulates a baseball game between the Nationals and the Mets based on performance data by batting position over
the course of the 2014 season. The outcome of the game is dispalyed in an alert, and the browser displays the outcome of
each at bat.

To run, simply load baseball1.html in your web browser and click "Run Simulator."

Right now, it naively assumes that on a hit, each runner advances the same number of bases as the batter.
